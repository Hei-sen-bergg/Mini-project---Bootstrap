# Mini-project---Bootstrap
This mini-project presents a fully responsive travel website crafted using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It highlights a dynamic layout designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring effortless accessibility across different devices. The project revolves around a fictional travel company showcasing its services, featuring profiles of its professional team members, and providing information about the company's background and contact details. Additionally, the website includes links to the social media profiles of both the individuals and the organization.


This marks my debut project with Bootstrap, and I'm delighted to have completed it. It has sparked my enthusiasm to delve into more such projects. While working on this project, I encountered challenges and made mistakes, but each obstacle served as a valuable learning experience, motivating me to continue moving forward and improving my skills..
